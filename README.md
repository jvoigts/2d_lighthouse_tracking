# lighthouse_tracking


This is code for tracking lighthouse receivers with a teensy 3.6
The pulse length tresholds are hard coded for the deafule 3.6 clk rate of 180 MHz - running this on other hardware will require adjusting the length tresholds.

Uses the elapsedCycles library by mlu (https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/29463-A-simple-class-for-sub-microsecond-timing?mode=hybrid&styleid=2)
